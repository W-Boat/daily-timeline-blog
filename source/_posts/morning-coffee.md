There's something magical about that first sip of perfectly brewed coffee in the morning. Today's blend was particularly exceptional.

The aroma filled the kitchen as I prepared my usual pour-over. The Ethiopian beans I picked up from the local roastery last week have this wonderful floral note that pairs beautifully with the crisp morning air.

## Today's Brewing Notes

- **Beans**: Ethiopian Yirgacheffe
- **Grind**: Medium-fine
- **Water temp**: 195Â°F
- **Brew time**: 4 minutes

These small rituals that start our day are what make life beautiful. Each cup is a moment of mindfulness before the world demands our attention.

What does your perfect morning look like?
